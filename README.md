# SHSS.JunkMessage.Tester

There is a bug in the offical site of Shenzhen High School of Science (SHSS), which is my former high school back in China.

The bug can allows the user to submit request in multiple times rapidly.

So I just wrote a testing tool for the teachers and IT managers in SHSS and RMIT.

**Anyway, do not use it for illegal purpose. Just for testing. This is completely NOT a hacking tool.**
